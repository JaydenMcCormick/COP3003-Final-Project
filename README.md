# Course and Title of Project
COP 3003 - Candy Inventory System

# Project Functionality
My final project will be a console based application on the topic of making an inventory system for a candy business. It prompts the user and calculates ingredients bought, used, and overall money earned when completed bags of candy are sold and stores them in a text file.

# Project Reason
My reason for making this project is because one of my best friends runs a candy business. His current method of inventory just relies on looking at what he has left over after making candy to see when he should buy more ingredients, and doing rough calculations in his head for how much he usually makes and how often he makes them for the overall money made.
